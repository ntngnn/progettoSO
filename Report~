-WHAT?
 
 Implementation of disastrOS semaphores.

-HOW?
 
 semopen: if semaphore has not already been created , we allocate a new semaphore (with its descriptors) and we return the semaphore descriptor .
          Else we return descriptor of existing semaphore.

 semclose: we close semaphore and its descriptors ,then free the "space" allocated by semopen.

 semwait: calling process decreases semaphore count , if count <=0 process will be scheduled in waiting list.
	  Else caliing process acces in critical section . 
	  job done ->return 0 .

 sempost : calling process increases semaphore count , if count <= 0 fisrt process in waiting list placed in ready list.
	   job done ->return 0 .


-HOW RUN? 
        
        ./disastrOS_test by shell
